Client Code
NOTE: The server will restart when the client aborts / disconnects the socket.

Keep socket open unless calling a read request or an error occurs. IF an error message is printed then
the server must be re-run as well as the client as the server will notice the socket has disconnected and will
abort / disconnect from the connected port

from socket import *

''' Create helper functions. For Client as defined in assignment description need to prepare MessageRequest, 
create socket and connect to server, send messagerequest, read request from server and display the information, 
  finally close socket return resources to OS and exit. 
  
  IDEA: create 4 helper functions to handle each of the 4 main steps.
  NOTE: " If any of these steps do not succeed, the client should print an appropriate error message, close the socket (if open),
and exit without attempting the remaining steps. "
